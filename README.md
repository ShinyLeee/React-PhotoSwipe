# React-PhotoSwipe

A pure react photo gallery component inspired by [PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe).

## Caveat

- React-PhotoSwipe only has one dependency `styled-components` which prevent global css pollution and without import css files when using react components.

- React-PhotoSwipe suppose you have `requestAnimationFrame` polyfill.
